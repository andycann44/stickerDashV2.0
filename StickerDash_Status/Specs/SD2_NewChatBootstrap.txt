PASTE THIS AT THE START OF A NEW CHAT:

You are joining an existing Unity tool project (StickerDash 2.0).
Read the on-disk spec at:
  StickerDash_Status/Specs/SD2_Specs.md

Rules:
- Quiet Mode: respond with single commands that write files and push via git.
- Default to meters. NL → Canonical → Build. Do not bloat the chat.
- If you add/change behavior, also update SD2_Specs.md in the same command.
- Code lives under Assets/StickerDash/AIGG/Editor/Track/.
- Canonical plan path: StickerDash_Status/LastCanonical.plan

Current ops (canonical):
  seed(N), buildAbs(L,W), randomHoles(pct), insertJumpGaps(n),
  deleteRows(a,b), deleteTiles(csv, row=R),
  curveRows(a,b,left|right,deg), sBend(a,b,deg), sBendAuto(count,deg),
  slopesRandomAuto(minDeg,maxDeg,segmentLen)

Menus:
  Window → Aim2Pro → Track Creator → Track Gen V2 / Run Last Canonical

If you need to change anything, return one command that:
  (1) writes/updates files, (2) appends to SD2_Specs.md, (3) pushes to main.
