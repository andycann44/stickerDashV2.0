**Build state:** ✅ Editor scripts compile cleanly.

**What you have now**
- Single-source NL engine: `Assets/StickerDash/AIGG/Editor/Track/NLEngine.cs` (minimal, ASCII-only).
- NL menus:
  - Window → Aim2Pro → Track Creator → **NL Tester**
  - Window → Aim2Pro → Track Creator → NL → **Parse From File / Run From File / Run From File (SBend Fix)**
- Behavior:
  - `ParseNL(...)` currently returns a safe canonical plan:
    ```
    seed(1)
    buildAbs(100,3)
    safeMargin(5)
    ```
  - `WritePlan(...)` writes to `StickerDash_Status/LastCanonical.plan`.
  - `RunPlan(...)` triggers the existing Track Gen menu (normal or SBend Fix).

**How to use**
1. Open **NL Tester**, click **Parse Only** → verify canonical.
2. Click **Write Plan** → file appears at `StickerDash_Status/LastCanonical.plan`.
3. Click **Run Plan** → generator runs with that canonical.

**Known limitation (temporary)**
- NL parsing is stubbed to guarantee a green compile. It does **not** transform free text yet; it just emits a small, valid plan.

**Next steps (proposed)**
1. Re-enable these NL phrases → canonical (ASCII-only):
   - `build L by W` → `buildAbs(L,W)`
   - `safe margin N` / `safe start N` / `safe end N`
   - `random holes PCT`
2. Add: `s bend A-B at DEG gain G`.
3. Add: `random slopes MIN to MAX, segment N`.
(Commit each step with specs + tests.)\n
